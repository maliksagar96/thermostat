Thermostat

It is a great project to start working on Molecular Dynamics. All the codes are written in fortran. 

This code contains 4 different folders along with all the results in .jpg format. All files are present except the maxwell boltzmann distribution files but they can be generated
with a little pain. 

The basic MD file contains a simple simulation of Lennard Jones fluid of 600 particles in a 15 x 15 x 15 box. This is implementation of NVE system.

Maxwell boltzmann distribution is carried out in the second folder.

Post equilibrium contains some interesting code. The MB distribution law can be plotted only after the equilibrium is achieved. This folder generates the data output required to 
plot MB distribution.

Thermostat folder contains the code to Implment NVT system.

Again all the folders contain the outputs and results which are easy to visualize and analyse.
